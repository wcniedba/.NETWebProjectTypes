# ASP.NET Web Project Types (VS2022)
Visual Studio 2022 has many different types of projects under **C# | All Platforms | Web**.  The solution in this repo contains one project for each type of project you can create (organized using solution folders). All projects were created using their default settings.  Each project is named the exact same name as the project template itself when you click File > New Project in Visual Studio.  The only exception are the projects listed under ASP.NET Framework Project Types.  All of these projects use the same template "ASP.NET Web Application (.NET Framework)".  The reason there are 5 separate projects listed under this project type is because once you select that project type, you are given 5 different choices on what type of web application to create.

* Web Project Types (Solution File)
  * ASP.NET Core Project Types (Folder)
    * ASP.NET Core Empty
    * ASP.NET Core Web API
    * ASP.NET Core Web App
    * ASP.NET Core Web App MVC
  * ASP.NET Framework Project Types (Folder)
    * **NOTE**: _All of the projects in this folder were created using the "ASP.NET Web Applicaion (.NET Framework)" project type. Once you select this project type you are then given the option of which **type** of application to create.  One project for each type of project has been created in this folder._
